# resources
one of the best ways to learn how to code is to learn online. in fact, it's the way i taught myself how to code. here are my recommended resources for JavaScript:
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [The Modern Javascript Tutorial](https://javascript.info)
